## Executive Summary

The Amazon Bedrock Workshop Module 06 demonstrates how to integrate Amazon Bedrock with popular open-source frameworks like LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI. The module consists of 11 Jupyter notebooks that showcase various applications ranging from simple chatbots to complex agentic systems with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) capabilities. The notebooks are organized into two main categories: high-level use cases (text generation with LangChain) and advanced agentic frameworks with evaluations and RAG. This module provides a comprehensive overview of how Amazon Bedrock can be leveraged with open-source tools to build sophisticated AI applications.
